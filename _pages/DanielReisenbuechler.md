Hi, I am Daniel, a math graduate from Technical University of Munich. Now at University of Regensburg, I am a PhD student in CS working in computational pathology. My research focuses on explainability, attention and multi-modal techniques in deep learning. 

Outside of academia, I enjoy traveling the world and having a nice time with friends.
