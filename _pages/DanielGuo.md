My name is Daniel (Zhenhao) Guo, an undergraduate student at New York University majoring in Computer Science. My research focuses on AI for Healthcare, with particular interest in developing vision–language models and data-centric approaches for the healthcare domain.

Outside of academics, I enjoy staying active through fitness and cooking healthy meals. During the winter, I like going on road trips with friends to go skiing.
