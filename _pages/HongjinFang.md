What’s up! My name is Hongjin, I’m an undergrad from Cornell majoring in Bioengineering and minoring in Computer Science. My research focuses on medical imaging segmentation for clinical applications.  

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, basketball, the guitar, and cooking! I also love exploring nature and working with wild life!
