Mr. Deng is a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/departments/computer-science/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu), advised by Dr. [Yuankai Huo](https://hrlblab.github.io). He conducts research in biomedical data analysis, particularly in digital pathology and gene expression data. His efforts are centered on `infusing domain knowledge` from the medical field into the design of `deep learning` models to assist in clinical research. Mr. Deng's research principles include building AI computer vision tools with cross-modal knowledge, advancing clinical research with AI-powered tools, democratizing pathology research, and incorporating foundation models to create a panoramic pathology atlas. Please find his latest [CV](https://github.com/ddrrnn123/ddrrnn123.github.io/blob/master/assets/CV/CV_2024Spring.pdf) and [full publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=B3UojrgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works). 

Besides being a research assistant at Vanderbilt University, Mr. Deng was a visiting student at [the University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu), as well as a member of the research staff at [Guangdong Provincial Cardiovascular Institute](https://www.gdghospital.org.cn/en/introductiontotheinstitute/info_itemId_85.html). He has also served as a software engineer intern at [Bridge Investment Group](https://www.bridgeig.com) in Charlotte, NC. Recently, he completed a summer internship at [Roche Diagnostics USA](https://diagnostics.roche.com/us/en/home.html) as an imaging scientist. More professional experience can be found in his latest [resume](https://github.com/ddrrnn123/ddrrnn123.github.io/blob/master/assets/CV/Resume-Ruining_2024_Fulltime.pdf).
