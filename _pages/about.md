Mr. Deng is a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/departments/computer-science/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu), advised by Dr. [Yuankai Huo](https://hrlblab.github.io). He conducts research in biomedical data analysis, particularly in digital pathology and gene expression data. His efforts are centered on `infusing domain knowledge` from the medical field into the design of `deep learning` models to assist in clinical research. Mr. Deng's research principles include building AI computer vision tools with cross-modal knowledge, advancing clinical research with AI-powered tools, democratizing pathology research, and incorporating foundation models to create a panoramic pathology atlas.
