I am currently an undergraduate student at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), working under the guidance of Prof. Xiaoying Tang. My research focuses on Deep Learning, Medical Image Segmentation and Classification.

Outside of research, I am passionate about painting and photography, and I find inspiration in different forms of artistic expression.
